Hi, I'm **Saeed** (aka **[thecoolestone](https://saeeedhany.github.io/thecoolestone/)**) — a digital crafter who builds things from the ground up.

I love understanding how systems work at their deepest levels, studying low-level concepts, and creating tools that enhance workflows or simply bring joy through craftsmanship.

I've built terminal utilities like :
- **[deasy](https://github.com/saeeedhany/deasy)** *A straightforward wrapper around yt-dlp*
- **[yduts](https://github.com/saeeedhany/yduts)** *A minimal, distraction-free CLI study timer*
- **[Unity-Cli-Manager](https://github.com/saeeedhany/Unity-Cli-Manager)** *A command-line interface for managing Unity projects*

to speed up everyday command-line work.

I also **[Write](https://saeeedhany.github.io/takallam/)** sometimes.

## What I'm Into

**Core Interests**
* Computer architectures and operating systems
* Multi-paradigm programming with a focus on scripting languages
* Efficient, interactive web design with SEO fundamentals

**Side Pursuits**
* Linux **[customization](https://github.com/saeeedhany/ThePrimeSetup.conf)** and system optimization
* Making a hobby Operating System named **[potatOS](https://github.com/saeeedhany/potatOS)**, And **[Documenting](https://saeeedhany.github.io/potatos.org/)** it.

## Long-Term Goals

* Contribute to open-source projects in Linux and low-level systems
