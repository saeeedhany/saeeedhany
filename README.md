Hi, I'm Saeed (aka **[thecoolestone](https://saeeedhany.github.io/thecoolestone/)**) — a digital crafter who builds things from the ground up.

I love understanding how systems work at their deepest levels, studying low-level concepts, and creating tools that enhance workflows or simply bring joy through craftsmanship.

## What I'm Into

**Core Interests**
* Computer architectures and operating systems
* Building systems from scratch
* Multi-paradigm programming with a focus on scripting languages
* Efficient, interactive web design with SEO fundamentals

**Side Pursuits**
* Linux customization and system optimization (Arch btw)
* Minimalist design and development

## Long-Term Goals

* Build a fully working operating system from scratch
* Contribute to open-source projects in Linux and low-level systems
* Create tools that improve developers' daily workflows
