hi, i’m saeed (aka **[thecoolestone](https://saeeedhany.github.io/thecoolestone/)** :D) — a digital crafter who enjoys building things from the ground up.

i love understanding how systems work at their deepest levels, and i spend a lot of time studying and implementing low-level concepts. sometimes i create tools and scripts to enhance my experience on my machine or just for the joy of crafting something useful.

currently learning & exploring :
- computer architectures and operating systems (and occasionally building one myself)
- working across different programming paradigms — though i enjoy scripting languages the most for their flexibility
- designing efficient, interactive, and visually appealing websites  
- search engine optimization (SEO) — i can make your site perform and look good

side interests :
- linux (arch btw) — tweaking, customizing, and improving my setup is my idea of fun
- minimalism in design and development
- text-based tools, especially vim and terminal environments

long-term goals :
- build a fully working operating system from scratch
- contribute to open-source projects related to linux and low-level systems
- make tools that improve developers' daily workflows
